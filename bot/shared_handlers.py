<strong>**Welcome to Football Games Bot** ‚öΩÔ∏è</strong>

The games are inspired by SDS Podcast.

<strong>**Available Games:**</strong>

<b>**Draft** üìù</b>
<b>**Guess the Player** ü§î</b>

<b>**How to Play Guess the Player:**</b>

- Start a new game with `/{GUESS_THE_PLAYER_NEW}[num rounds]`. The game has 2 rounds by default. You can have any number of rounds by adding it after the start command.

- After the round starts, the current player should send the hints and answer to the bot like this: `answer, hint1-hint2-hint3`.

- Every player has 2 tries and 3 questions for each player guess.

- If no one gets the answer right, the current player gets the point.

- To answer the question, prefix the answer with `the answer is [answer]`.

- To ask a question, use the command `/{GUESS_THE_PLAYER_ASK_Q}`. The current player must reply to the question message with their answer.

- There can be only one asked question at a time.

<b>**How to Play Draft:**</b>

- Start a new game with `/{DRAFT_NEW_COMMAND}`.

- After the game starts, you must decide the category, formation, and teams for the round.

- After deciding, set the round using `/{DRAFT_SET_STATE_COMMAND} [category], [team1-team2-team3...], formation`.

- The teams must be 11 + num players and with no duplicates.

- The supported formations are 433, 4231, 442, 532, 352.

- Each player will get a chance to pick a random team then pick the first player from it.

- Every player gets one pick from each team.

- No duplicates are allowed.

- At the end of the round, each player will get a free transfer from one of the teams that didn't get picked, but only the player will get to pick from it.

- At the end of the round, the teams will be displayed, and you must decide the best team to vote for.
